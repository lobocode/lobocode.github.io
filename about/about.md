Hungry for knowledge and curious by nature, as well said EÃ§a de Queiroz writer: "Curiosity, infinite complexity instinct take one hand to listen behind the doors and on the other to discover America". I'm fond of new discoveries, to find out how earch mechanism, system, program, and all the technological ecosystem. DevOps Engineer, I've made significant contributions with development, translation, review, patch and dissemination of open source technology. I'm user and **[Ambassador]()** the GNU/Linux Fedora in Brazil.
