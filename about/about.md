All decisions made by the people are the source of their values ​​and goals. People can have many different goals and values ​​such as fame, profit, love, survival, fun and freedom are just some of the values ​​that a person might have. When the goal is to help others as oneself, we call that idealism.   My work on free software is motivated by an idealistic goal: spreading freedom and cooperation. I want to encourage free software to spread, replacing proprietary software that forbids cooperation, and thus make our society better. I make my code available to use free software, not proprietary software in order to encourage other people who write software to make it free as well. I'm member **[Ambassador](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Lobocode){:target="_blank"}** the Fedora Project in Brazil.
